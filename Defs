OOPS-object-oriented programming, your overall program is made up of lots of different 
self-contained components (objects), each of which has a specific role in the program and 
all of which can talk to each other in predefined ways.

 A class is a template for multiple objects with similar features.
Classes resonate all the TERM features of a particular set of objects.

When you write a program in an object-oriented language, you donâ€™t define actual objects. 
You define classes of objects.
